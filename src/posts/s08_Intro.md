Hello to all fans of **DEFENDING GREATEST SERIES CHAMPIONS THE ATLANTA TREE FROGS!!!!**

 What an exciting playoff run! And all it took was to get a high enough seed that someone *else* could stand between us and the Archers, who have previously delighted in sweeping away our postseason hopes. Thank you Seers, for that and for an incredibly exciting Clover Division title bout. And of course, much respect to our Greatest Series opponents the Kansas City Stormchasers, who dragged us out through a hard-fought and frankly ridiculous full 7-game series. We saw players we do nothing but rag on pull out astonishing clutch performances, most notably the game 4 shutout from **Avery Gunn** that managed to make the Frog's only run the winning one. A shocker for a postseason that brutalized so many ace pitchers. And in the final game the bats truly came together for a lesson in never losing hope, as long as it's never over.

So how are we doing this round? 

Ah. **30-30.** That's certainly a record of some sort.

The bats have been sleepy this season, especially perpetual lead shoe **Dick Cline**, who is continuing to struggle to keep his OPS+ over 60. And the weak spots in our rotation are suffering more than ever as other teams around the league are investing in offense. **Juliana Charleston** is working hard to get her ERA up over 7 this season.

However! it is not a season without highlights - such as the 9th-inning *back-to-back grand slams* vs the Angles on day 105
