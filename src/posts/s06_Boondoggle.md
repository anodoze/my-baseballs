Greetings! In this column, I'll be offering insights on which Boons to goon over and which, in short, spell doom. 

Our first batch up for review will be the earliest boons offered to Fans: the fantasy creature Lesser Boons. These are, notably, the only Modifications which can grant defense Attribute boosts (and penalties!) on your players. The Attribute boosts and penalties from these Lesser Boons are some of the largest among the Modifications on offer. This makes the good fantasy creature Boons really good, but also makes others actively detrimental to your lineup or rotation.

Let's begin!

### ---ROBO---
The ROBO Modification is by far the most popular boon for both batters and pitchers - as of the start of Season 6, it's the only Lesser Boon with a population upwards of 500 players. This is mostly reflective of the fact it had two seasons of being the only boon on offer, but it remains a very respectable boon to put on a batter.

ROBO batters gain invaluable Discipline with only the highly-situational Cunning penalised - Cunning only being a priority for meme teams trying to rack up the Hit-By-Pitches. The Speed penalty has more obvious downsides, but would be a moot point on a high-Discipline player who's planning to walk to First anyway. Finally, the Arm bonus is a perfectly good boost to most of your Fielders, regardless of position.

A ROBO pitcher is a harder sell - as cool as the visual would be of a mechanised being taking to the mound. The Arm boost is fine, but Accuracy is generally considered a less-crucial Attribute in the pitcher's toolkit, especially compared to Presence - which is ROBO's penalised pitching stat. Unless this is on your last re-roll among offers to take the mound or increase your whole lineup's Greed, you're best looking elsewhere.
