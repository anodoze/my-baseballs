Friends. The pitching. it's very very bad. Most of our staff seems to be leaning on this deadball moment hoping it makes them look good enough to give them a pass. Only one pitcher exceeding 5 ERA this season! Wow!! 

We know the truth. It's time for some turnover. and with with two callups to work with... we can do so with speed. 

The worst of the worst are **Nate Appleby**, a ludicrously underqualified player pulled off the bench during the chaos of corruption, and **Juliana Charleston**, who's been throwing games for us since Season 0 and is managing an ERA of 6.93 despite the deadest balls we've ever seen. she's got to got to go.
