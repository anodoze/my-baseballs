We've been putting it off long enough. Now that we have a baseball player instead of a cardboard cutout standing between 2nd and 3rd base, we can really consider which of our starting pitchers truly sucks the most horse shit. Since they haven't gotten much attention thus far, let's just review them one by one.

#### **SP1 Omari Bryant** | S5 ERA: **6.75**

Career ERA: **4.40** - **4.48** - **4.84** - **4.36**

Omari Bryant is a frogfan favorite. The first player we sent up together from the Amphibian league, who has charmed us all with his impeccable comedic timing. He threw a career-low ERA of 4.36 last season! The only Tree Frog starting pitcher who has never ended a season with an ERA over 5. In season one, he was on the Superstar starting rotation. This season, he was RP3. If he can't pull it together in the back half of the season, it might be time to send him down. Still, after a baffling rager on the field earlier this season, his fastballs are suddenly hitting triple-digits. will it be enough to recover? All eyes are on you, Omari.

#### **SP2 Avery Gunn** | S5 ERA: **3.55** 

Career ERA: **4.14**-**4.61**-**5.31**-**5.45** 

Avery. Oh Avery. I wish you were good so I could make some kind of joke about you being A Very Gun. Instead you have made a different kind of joke by making the Superstar team in the embarassment position of RP3. You've brought your ERA into the basically-competent zone, better keep it there bud.

#### **SP3 Juliana Charleston** | S5 ERA: **4.54** 

Career ERA: **4.42**-**5.62**-**5.69**-**6.39** 

Another pitcher who is just sliding past mediocrity into active sabotage whose 4.54 ERA feels like a lucky day. good god.

#### **SP4 Marjorie Gould** | S5 ERA: **4.72** 

Career ERA: **5.32**-**4.65**-**6.35**-**6.61** S

Marjorie has taken to doing shots on the field and threatening the manager with a knife (why does she have that!?) if they so much as look at her funny. At this point it seems like the only way to get her off the mound will be to get her off the team entirely. 

#### **SP5 Jose Mercier** | Season 5 ERA: **3.21**

Career ERA: **5.26** - **4.25** - **4.72** - **4.46** 

Congratulations Jose Mercier: you've won the Got the Memo award for realizing that you are all pitching for your lives this season. Two shutouts?? You kidding?? Keep it up man.
