✨ **Intuitive** – 10% increased batting Attributes when facing a right-handed Pitcher. - just a flat boost against most pitchers. fantastic. will proc the most often of all batting boons

these two will proc less often than Intuitive, but does make them more of a threat to the occasional lefty, since they're affected by but not dependent on handedness
