# Amphibian League Midseason Review

Boy howdy, it hss been a rough start. with the ups come the downs and we are *down*, under the Shine even. Props to The Yilmaz and new callup Claude Ai for putting up excellent numbers despite the rest of the team being in a haze. If there's any light in the tunnel it's that we actually went on a similar slide last season, it just happened after we banked a bunch of wins, so we didn't have to see red. Let's hope the Frogs can climb out of this hole. Let's not dwell too long and skip straight to who's suffering most severely.

**SS R. Pan:** jesus christ. **.547 OPS**. The Yilmaz has more SLG alone than that. your days under the canopy are numbered.

**SP2 Avery Gunn:** you've had your ups and downs pal but this season you sucked so bad you got drafted to the comedy home-run-serving position in the all-star game. 

Now, let us turn to the Amphibian League, where the goins-on have been much more fun to watch. With the Cool Bugs unseated from their throne (but still a threat in the rankings!), the top of the field is very crowded. We're going to review the frontrunners, but there is a very good chance the winner isn't on this list!

**Vienna Red Housing Architects**

The architect's **DH Christine Levesque** could finally kick Matteo Che out of the Frog's currently nearly-dead DH spot.

And A shortstop that's even half decent still makes for a tempting replacement for R. Pan. **Jazz Copeland** could plug a serious hole in the batting lineup

**Carefee Silly Little Ducks**

The Ducks from Carefee have a particularly compelling Shortstop pick. **Theresa Ryan** is a fairly good batter and an *excellent* defender, at **16.4 OAA** they ranked 31st in all of MMOLB. 

**Eden Ultimate Room Mates**

A good roommate is hard to find. does the dishes. gives you kisses. and most importantly: fucking rules at playing baseball.

The Room Mate's SS Stephanie Yalçın would be the All Gas answer to our shortstop problem. 147 OPS+ and even appears to know how to play her position.

The Room Mates have an embarassment of pitching riches as well, SP2 Gail Giraud would make a fine replacement for Avery Gunn, who I have watched throw enough games that I'm getting much less skittish about gambling on *ooh what if it was defense.*
