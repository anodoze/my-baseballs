As we move into the scouting conversation, a few notes particular to this season: our pitching is absolutely dire, a catastrophe from top to bottom except for **SP1 Sam Genet.** We aren't likely to see another championship without addressing it. HOWEVER. With major changes to the pitching game incoming, it might be the most-dangerous possible season to call one up. 

Instead, I'll be highlighting batters once again, but possibly for the last time in a while. We should plan to be picky from here on, the holes that need patching just aren't that deep on our offense these days. But, if we can call up a replacement for our last truly bad batter **Matteo Che**, and pull Cameron off the bench in place of **Ethan Dupuis**, we can lock in a very solid lineup, with the bonus of finally getting Claude in front of anyone who can *actually hit* on the wraparound, which might help him bring in even more runs despite falling in the batting order.
