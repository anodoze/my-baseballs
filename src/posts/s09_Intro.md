Good MMOLBing frogfans we're here again. I can't lie, this one's rough, been a while since we've been under .500 at the midseason checkin. 8 wins over the Shine are not covering for middling performance overall and absolute annihilation vs the Archers, who account for a third of all our losses. Worse, we've now lost our second-best batter **Cameron Nkurunziza** and second-best pitcher **Cobalt Stojanovska** to containment. In the pitching department in particular we are truly suffering, with two ascended bench players making me wish for the return of even **Jose *Fucking* Mercier**, let alone Cobalt. 

The Frogs' offense is being led by Season 0 OG **Andrew Möller** of all people. Two straight muscle injections over the past two seasons have taken him from flagging calldown target to genuine slugger. We'll see if he can keep it up! Rookie **Yui Nakanishi** is proving to be rock-solid defensively, carrying her 38% RCS up from the Lesser Leagues, and her batting has been solid if not spectacular as well.
