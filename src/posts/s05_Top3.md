It's been a turbulent season, with league-leaders turning over almost daily and only very rarely holding a whole-win lead. As of the halfway mark, we have 10 teams within 5 wins of the title. Let's examine our top 3! 

### Kitty Hawk Flying Aces

The Flying Aces have a delightful starting rotation but the clear star here is SP5 Pie Hurley. Pie's midseason ERA of 2.33 counts as a *skid*, a *rough patch*. They topped the strikeout charts in season 3 (284!), and had an eye-popping 0.78 ERA in season 4. Despite the early-season trip that's brought their numbers into ordinary-human territory, they've already thrown 3 shutouts this season. 

Also let us not skim over the fact their name is **Pie** fucking **Hurley**. It really doesn't matter if Jose is having a career season, if the Flying Aces win, we have to get this clown on the Tree Frogs immediately.

### Java Run Time Environments

The Java Run Time Environments have a starting rotation I would call "solid". SP4 Marlilyn Giraud is sitting pretty at 59 ERA-, but her past performance and middling FIP- makes me wonder if she can repeat this performance long-term.

We have a similarly sticky situation with the batting lineup - the Java DH Gary Grass has been rock-solid up until this season, hitting 151 OPS+ in season 4 but crashing to just above even at 103 in season 5.

The RTEs are this season's wait-and-see team. You can't win if you have nothing to offer, but this pick will take more info and some serious digging and deliberation (and possibly peeping some defensive numbers if they are published in time).

### Lincoln Cromulent Partidges

It's everyone's homies the Cromies! Out of their starters, I'm eyeing SP4 Bruna Ortega.

Marjorie is our most consistently-poor pitcher, and while Bruna isn't putting up startling numbers they are consistently good.

Aria Carter in the SP2 spot is also worth considering, they had a rough season 3 but have since gotten a handful of buffs and ERA- of 64 followed by 65 is respectable.

This is likely to be decided by which Tree Frogs pitcher biffs it the most.
