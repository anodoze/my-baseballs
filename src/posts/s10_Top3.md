At the beginning of the season, there was much panic about the state of our teams, but it looks like the top of the league is still the usual suspects. This season everyone in the top 3 is a familiar face.

**Jupiter Big Bad Beasts 46-14 +162 RD**

Well well well, look who's here again. The Big Bad Bridesmaids are once again our midseason leaders. They've always had the runs, but do they have the *wins* in them to finally take a title?

One half of the Beast's dominance is their bats, who I have hyepd at length here. However, the other side of their absurd run differentials is their star starters. **Katherine McDonald** and **Penelope Holder** have been some of the most valuable players in Amphibian League season after season, and whichever develops into the strongest player by the end of this season is likely to become a Frog. 

**No Tuesday Problems 43-17 +104RD**

The Problems are back refreshed from our vacation in Liberty League and in the running once again to see if we can snatch a win! We have always leaned on our pitching and I have two particular stars to offer:

**Maude Carr 1.50 ERA:** a whiff merchant who will make you put the ball right on the ground if you do manage to hit it. allows a home run in roughly 1 in 3 games.

**Crust Charlton 1.51 ERA:** a veteran player who's been with us since season 1, the second most-valuable pitcher in Liberty League when we took out little vacation. Crust is pure gas, leaning entirely on strikeouts.

**Freeze Criminal Person 41-19 +104 RD** 

okay, okay I said all that. I said we have to kill our pitchers, we *know* we have to fix our pitching, so so desperately... *but*

**Gadget Somersbyshire 1.283 OPS, 33 Home Runs:** what the hell. In this season of offensive privation this guy practically gets to bat twice every time he steps to the plate. Gadget is singlehandedly making all the pitchers in this league look like punks compared to our neighbors. You know how you throw a shutout against Freeze? *You walk Gadget Somersbyshire*. 

We can't not send Gadget to the bigs if we get the chance. we betray ourselves if we don't.
