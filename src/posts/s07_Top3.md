Batting is back in style baby! And it gave the leaderboard a good hard shake this season, but we largely have familiar faces in the top ten -- with one particularly notable exception.

With position rules opening up, we have some more flexibility in our player choices this time! Let's peep the top of the league.

### San Fernando Moral Bankruptcy Coyotes

Ok, so *maybe* the Coyotes rolled up from Liberty League and immediately took up residence at the top of the leaderboard and *maybe* that hurt our feelings a little bit. No one has held onto the lead here from midseason through to the champs since the Cool Bugs (home of Claude Ai) back in Season 3. Are the Coyotes ready to be the next?

**C Noodlehead Shephard** is putting up the best batting numbers so far this season. This doesn't seem like a consistent feature -- they've had some, let's be polite, wild swings in performance. But we *could* finally Kill Richard Cline.

In the outfield, **CF Serenity Ko** could take up Honus Tyler's place in left field. Serenity looks to be a capable defender 

In accordance with strident public comment on the part of the team owner, we have opted not to perceive the Coyotes' pitching rotation.

### No Tuesday Problems

Well how about that! The first appearance in this section for the team that plays for your humble Editor In Chief. We're gunning for our second championship run -- it would be the first in the league, what do we have to show for it?

**C Yui Nakanishi** is having a bit of a bum season but has the longest history of reliable batting on the squad, and snipes thieves quite reliably. I believe in her. Kill Richard Cline.

**3B Y. Alonso** - my most merciless infielder is also... getting on base this season? wimpiest guy on the squad just plinking the ball in whatever direction and sprinting for his life. he's fun! yeah. sure.

**SP uuuuh look** they're all weird right now, ok? Cobalt 2 with left-handed and Strong Starter is getting blown up for 10 runs at random. these bitches cannot be trusted currently.

### Jupiter Big Bad Beasts

Back on the board after losing their spot in the very last game of the season last round, the Beasts are out for blood. And this, *This* is a batting lineup. *Average* OPS+ of 128

The stone-cold standout is a repeat from last season: **DH Angela Wen**, 180 OPS+, just annihilating baseballs left and left, she's hit a double as often as she's been struck out so far this season. Stunning work, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't rooting for her specifically.
