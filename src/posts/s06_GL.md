## Opportunities...
The gap between the Tree Frogs' original post-clone roster and the potential callups in the top of the Amphibian League only grows. Any of them could be replaced by a sufficiently-skilled Amphibian, but a few players in particular are in serious danger of being replaced. 

**C Richard Cline** - welcome back to the shitlist! .610 OPS! god damn!! 

**1B Aline Danvers** - She's had her share of good seasons, even excellent ones, but Aline is struggling as the seasons go on, barely breaking .700 OPS so far this season.

**Matteo Che** - is actually playing pretty well this time around, but has a long record of some of the sorriest slugging you've ever seen in the big leagues. our eyes are always on you Matteo

**Starting Pitchers Not Named Cobalt Stojanovska** - Yes, even you Avery, unless you keep it up.
