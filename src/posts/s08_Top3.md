Looking forward, let's take a peek down into who's-who of the Amphibian League. Who might be the next Tree Frog?

### Freeze Criminal Person

Freeze has seen the top 3 before, but this time they've taken a commanding lead by the power of a lineup that is brutal from toe to tip. (and their pitchers aren't slouching either!).

**2B Gadget Somersbyshire** has been with Freeze since Season 1 and has been one of their heaviest hitters for that entire stretch. Send him up to get him out of our hair.

**SS Melanie Salah** is one of the league's hardest partiers. this absolute brick is having a banner season, with a .967 OPS bouyed by a .420 OBP. That last weed batter we called up was **Claude Ai**, should we do it again?

**DH Pavel Irwin** deserves a mention for actually leading this team in hitting this season, but as he is distinctly less bricklike than the other two, he seems most due for a downturn as the season progresses.

### Vienna Red Housing Architects

The Archs present a challenge for Greater League recruitment - a balanced team with no standout aces. Players that look strong on paper are flagging this season for one reason or another. We always reserve judgement for the end of the season but for the Archs more than most. When looking at teams like this, I'm inevitably thinking about which players we most want to *drop* from the Frogs.

**LF Jago Guzman** is typically a power hitter, if he recovers from this midseason slump he might slip into the DH spot so we can finally dump Matteo Che.

**SP5 July Shah** is a reliable starter who would be huge value-add if it meant we could finally stop having 6+ ERA seasons from Juliana Charleston.

### Bumbletown Bumblebees

They have a Bee League belt, but can they climb to the top of Amphibian? 

**C July Duran** is not a heavy hitter, but they have a respectable OBP and an eye-watering RCS% of 38. Cline could come to his end.

**CF Riley Gashi** is leading the Bumblebees in hitting to the tune of 163 OPS+ and could easily fit in the Frog's DH spot

**2B Quingyu Polanco** is the best of the Bees at getting on base, and is also a servicable defender who could swap in for Andrew Moller at 3B if he continues to slide in performance this season
