Good mmolbing Frogfans! We've come up for air since season 4 but we're still just treading water, hanging on to a narrow winning record at 31-29, but this is Clover division, so that's only good for 5th place. 

Claude Ai and The Yilmaz have been smashing baseballs in a season that has otherwise been brutal to batters across the board. Following them up is Theresa Ryan, who has not only patched up the biggest hole in our defense, but is batting even with George Maeda in her rookie season! We're happy to have you girl.

**Matteo Che** hits the wall of shame once again for putting up just godawful batting numbers when batting is literally his only job, but it looks like his career strategy of never being the biggest problem we have to solve may hold for quite a while
