**Jupiter Big Bad Beasts 43-17 +162RD**

The Beasts have been here many times before. Amphibian's perennial bridesmaid, now out in front by a hair. If you've been watching the batting leaderboards you may already know these names.

**DH Angela Wen 193 OPS+** - the BABIPiest batter in all Amphibian, getting them on base is practically a coinflip. With 3 solid sluggers to follow up, Angela has the makings of an absolutely lethal leadoff.  

**CF Anthony Wilcox 196 OPS+** - or, we could just call up another slugger. can you ever really have enough? Tony's been parked on the homerun leaderboard all season and wouldn't it just be nice to have them do that for Atlanta?

**Lincoln Cromulent Partridges 43-17 +104RD**

The Cromies are back!! whether they're on the podium or not, every Amphibian League leader has learned to fear them, as they dilligently drag back anyone daring to pull too far ahead of the pack. This lineup is stacked but even-handed, Corruption has already shuffled the Tree Frogs' defense and it's likely it will some more before we're done. It's likely that will be a tiebreaker unless their manager feels like starting to play favorites.

**Carefree Silly Little Ducks 40-20 +118RD**

The home team of Atlanta's stalwart shortstop Theresa Ryan is back on in the race! 

**1B Johanne Johnson 138 OPS+** Johanne is, much like their former teammate, a reliable hitter who can also contribute defensively. We ought to be able to slot them in wherever the holes are after the chaos of this season.

**SP4 Luther Parkin ERA- 56** is an interesting case, able to put down batters without relying on raw pitch speed. If we're going to call up a pitcher, Luther is the type we're looking for
