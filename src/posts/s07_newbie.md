### New Manager's Notes

From the Dragon Salty Burger Artists

As a new team manager as of the tail-end of Season 6, I wanted to share tips and tricks I've picked up as we head into Season 7! Today we'll go over Augment, Clubhouse, and the Hall of Unmaking. Let's hop to it!

Dailies & Where to Find Them!

Augment offers upgrades to your players' attributes. You get three rerolls every day, and they apply at a specific time every day, so don't be afraid to take your time deciding which to grab! If you aren't sure if an upgrade fits the role, be sure to check out the Info -> Glossary -> Attributes section of your manager's handbook.

Clubhouse is the place to meet your players. Every day, you can go talk to one of them and learn about their skills in various roles. This will help you figure out how to help bolster the skills your players have! For batters, I suggest checking baserunning. For your pitchers, check defense! If there's a particular player who you can't quite fit in elsewhere, make sure to check if they'd work better in another role.

Hall of Unmaking offers two dailies as of Season 7, Recomposition and Purification. Recomposing may seem scary at first, but worry not! It gets easier as time goes on, and the important part, position, stays the same. It may help to think of it as a form of metamorphosis. Send one in, choose a new player out of three! When making the decision of who to bring onto the team, lean on both how fun you find the names and the attributes.

Purification allows you to remove the corruption status in exchange for gold. I highly reccomend this, as other then the daily Urrlok's grace, it's the fastest way to get money for equipment!

Thank you for reading. See you next time, and have baseball joy!
