Another season, another precarious Clover League lead for the frogs. Can we hold it this time? There's a rift in the batting lineup, with **Claude Ai, Theresa Ryan, and George Maeda** all putting up over .900 OPS to carry games after game. The rest trailing at under .800. Including **The Yilmaz?** Are you sick bud? What's going on?

New callup **Sam Genet** is holding an uneasy 2.86 ERA, split between impressive hard lockdowns that included serving a maddux to the Archers and shakier starts that left our bats unable to make up the difference.

**Cobalt Stojanovska** might show what's possible for Sam, after a very similarly inconsistent debut they have been spending their sophmore season shutting the Clover League down to the tune of a 1.60 ERA. Even got in a revenge shutout on the Merfolk for good measure. Can you please stop getting ejected and letting the bullpen out though.

**Targeted**

We were riding terrifically high until we got soundly thumped in our 12-game shootout with the Archers in which you can barely tell which pitcher started - 22% of earned runs vs Cobalt this Season came from a single Pam Yam Grand Slam. The Archers are building a record of booting us unceremoniously out of the playoffs. Last season we spent all of our Archers wins on the regular season and got swept out--can we reverse the pattern this time?
