It's been another turbulent season with plenty of turnover in the top ranks. The Phoenix Spiders held a steady lead at the top for quite a few days, but have since been kicked off the top 3 by run-differential tiebreaker. All former league champions have been shouldered out of the top 10. If past seasons are anything to go by, the barest hint of complacency will be severely punished. Let's take a look at who's treading water at the top of the pile.

### Jupiter Big Bad Beasts

The Big Bad Beasts took the early lead this season, and after a short dip down the ranks came up to hold a healthy 3-win lead over the rest of the league. They're well-named, with several fascinatingly-beastly players heading up their so-far successful Championship bid

**LF Anthony Wilcox** - Tony would be the perfect piece to complete our power-hitting outfield. When he makes contact with the ball it's a wonder he doesn't just slice it in two. And he's no slouch as a defender either.

**DH Angela Wen** - Imagine having a Designated Hitter who could actually hit! Angela's precise batting has been confounding defenders up and down the Amphibian League

**SP1 Penelope Holder** -  Penelope is having an excellent run this season, currently sitting at 2.08 ERA and attempting to scrape it down still further with a *blistering* pitch speeds. You might think a sinker isn't supposed to be going 128mph, but Penelope pointedly disagrees.

### Crapo Player Removal Rock

The Rock has climbed the ranks through truly vicious selection for only the best, and it's finally brought them so near the peak of the ranks. In particular, they have a brick wall of a starting rotation, with 4 starting pitchers under 3 ERA. 

**SP3 Anna Humphreys** is leading the pack with a 2.22 ERA, but at this level one or two runs in the wrong place could easily shake up this team's rankings. Anna has real Frog potential, but if she wants a roster spot she's got to stay locked in or be overtaken by one of her peers, especially splitter-chucking **SP1 Sam Genet**.

**1B Mecha Glass** is also one to watch out for. They don't quite have a resume to show for it, but their heart, and arms, and legs, all grew well over 3 sizes in the offseason

### Freeze Criminal Person

The baffled and baffling Amphibian enforcers are bringing their strange, spaghetti-based brand of the law to the league. While you might argue with the value and quality of their policing, there's no arguing with their baseball prowess.

**3B Goober Kamal** - Goober came out of the offseason ready to *hit*, any where, any way, any how. And he's doing it to the tune of .949 OPS to open the season

**SP3 Cameron Kubo** - A lefty with an eclectic pitch mix and precise control, Cameron is a commanding and consistent force on the mound.
