# Beginner's Guide to MMOLB

Welcome to Massively Multiplayer Online League Baseball. We're all playing a work in progress, so it can be tough to get your bearings. Hopefully this can help. This guide is not meant to be comprehensive, but will hopefully cover enough ground to help you get started

[Useful Third-Party Websites](#useful-third-party-websites) | [Choosing a Favorite Team](#choosing-a-favorite-team) | [Drafting Your Team](#drafting-your-team)

## [MMOLB Official website](https://www.mmolb.com)

## Useful Third-Party Websites

[freecashews](https://freecashe.ws) - website for viewing player stats. You can search for your team on the [teams](https://freecashe.ws/teams) page and see how they're performing

[EMMOLB](https://lunanova.space) - this is a third-party viewer for mmolb, with a game viewer and player pages that are more-detailed than vanilla MMOLB. It also allows you to more easily follow more teams than just your own on MMOLB. 

#### EMMOLB wants my Team ID, what's that?

your Team ID is the string of numbers and letters at the end of the url on your public team page, for example:
[https://mmolb.com/team/**6806d81fee9f269dec724b8a**](https://mmolb.com/team/6806d81fee9f269dec724b8a)

If you go to [Manage My Team](https://mmolb.com/manage-team), then click on your team's name, that will take your team's page, where you can find the ID. freecashews will also show the Team ID when you search for your team. 

## Choosing a Favorite Team
This choice determines which Greater League team you'll be following, which will put their games on the home page when the Greater League is playing. It also determines which Lesser League your team plays in. During the regular season, you only play games against teams in your Lesser League. At the end of each season, the League Champion will have a player called up to the Greater League. All league members can vote on which player this will be in addition to the site-wide Proclamations.

You can choose a new Favorite Team at the following times:
- when you first join MMOLB
- during the first half of an ongoing season
- sometimes, during breaks, though due to technical shenaningans this can vary

## Drafting your Team

If you've just signed up, the player slots in Manage My Team will be empty. When you go to draft for that position, you'll be given 3 players to choose from. These will stay the same if you back out, so don't worry about losing them if you have to go off and do something else. Once you're done drafting, your team will start playing in the next round of Lesser League matches.

On the draft page, you'll be shown the player's primary attributes for Pitching or Batting, depending on their position. There are also 3 stats on this page that are unusual:

- Luck: this will be grouped with Defense later, but its effects are not well-understood and are probably relevant to all players
- Baserunning: this is an average of 4 attributes 
- Defense: this is an average of 8 attributes

You will be able to get more-detailed access to defense and baserunning after you've drafted.

For more detail on what these attributes do, see the [Attributes](#attributes) section

## Daily Activities

[this section will be updated when we see what changes season 6 brings]

## Attributes

Attribute Definitions are taken from the [mmolb glossary](https://mmolb.com/glossary), plus some description of community concensus of what we think they do. Attributes in **Bold** are considered especially critical, attributes in *Italics* will probably not contribute much to overall player performance.

### Batting
- Aiming – Batter's ability to hit Line Drives

  More Aiming will cause batters to hit fewer ground balls and more line drives, which are harder to field and allow the batter to get on base more easily. This competes slightly with Lift.

- Contact – Batter's ability to make contact, putting the ball in play

  unsure of exact effect, generally seems to help get the ball in play

- *Cunning* – Batter's ability to draw a Hit By Pitch

  this is an extremely rare event, even doubling its frequency just won't have a large effect on a player's performance. it is extremely funny though

- Determination – Batter's ability to remain determined by fouling the ball

  This will help the batter stay at the plate instead of striking out by turning strikes into fouls, and hopefully eventually get a hit. This also forces the pitcher to throw more, tiring them out faster.

- Discipline – Batter's ability to remain disciplined at the plate, laying off of pitches outside the strike zone

  This will make your batter less likely to strike out swinging and more likely to draw a walk, both good

- Insight – Batter's ability to choose an optimal location to hit a ball in play

  makes hit balls harder to defend, so the batter is more likely to get on base

- Intimidation – Batter's ability to scare a pitcher away from throwing in the strike zone

  testing indicates this does not do what it says on the tin, but it's still really good so go for it

- Lift – Batter's ability to hit Fly Balls

  Makes the batter hit more fly balls and fewer ground balls or line drives. competes slightly with Aiming. Fly balls are more likely to turn into home runs than ground balls or line drives, but they are easier to field than line drives. Players with a lot of Lift will benefit most from extra Muscle to make fly balls into homers instead of outs.

- **Muscle** – Batter's ability to make powerful hits

  Muscle makes line drives and fly balls more likely to turn into homeruns. This is the attribute most correlated with OPS, it's really really good.

- *Selflessness* – Batter's willingness to hit into a sacrifice play

  we're not 100% sure what this does, but it doesn't seem worth spending points on at this time

- Vision – Batter's ability to track the pitch as it's coming at them

  the inverse of Discipline, this increases swings at pitches inside the strike zone, making a batter less likely to strike out looking. 

- Wisdom – Batter's ability to learn from each pitch

    Batter's ability to learn from each pitch

Priority – hidden attibute that determines a batter's position in the lineup

### Defense
- Acrobatics – Fielder's ability to field Line Drives
- Agility – Fielder's ability to field Fly Balls
- Arm – Fielder's ability to throw the ball
- Awareness – Fielder's ability to make tough plays
- Composure – Fielder's ability to play without making Errors
- Dexterity – Fielder's ability to make quick dextrous moves, preventing runners from getting extra bases
- *Patience* – Fielder's ability to field Popups
- Reaction – Fielder's ability to field Ground Balls

Defenders are highly specialized, so it's best to group them by position. Attributes are listed from most to least important.

**Outfield:** Acrobatics, Agility, Arm

**Infield:** Reaction, Composure, Arm (3B cares more about arm than any other infielder 2B also likes Acrobatics since they get line drives to the face sometimes)

**Catcher:** Awareness

**Pitchers:** you'll get augment options for them but tbh it does not really matter, as it's rare for pitchers to field the ball. The pitcher's most important defensive stats are their pitching stats.

### Baserunning
- *Greed* – Baserunner's willingness to attempt to  steal a base
- **Performance** – Baserunner's ability to distract fielders
- Speed – Baserunner's raw speed on the basepaths
- Stealth – Baserunner's ability to remain undetected when attempting to steal a base

### Pitching
- Accuracy – Pitcher's ability to pitch to their intended zone

  Extremely important for pitches that are intended to go in the zone, like fastballs, seems generally good 

- Control – Pitcher's ability to have control of their pitch, remaining inside the strike zone

  best for pitches that frequently go out of the zone, like sliders and knuckle curves, seems to cause batters to chase pitches more

- Defiance – Pitcher's ability to defy the Manager and remain in the game for longer

  Does exactly what it says on the tin. it's good on good pitchers, and bad on bad pitchers. it's doesn't seem to need to be raised beyond 3-4 stars to keep an excellent starter on the mound for complete games.

- Guts – Pitcher's ability to play better when their Energy is low

  improves a pitcher's performance when tired (~50 pitches thrown for starters and ~25 for relievers), it appears that guts is strong enough that many pitchers perform significantly better when "tired"

- Persuasion – Pitcher's ability to draw foul balls

  we belive this makes potential-hits into fouls instead. essentially pitcher-side determination. 

- Presence – Pitcher's ability to scare the batter, reduce powerful hits

  very important for preventing hits from becoming homeruns

- Rotation – Pitcher's ability to throw pitches with a high spin rate which are hard to hit

  best for in-zone pitches, especially fastballs, as it scares batters away from swinging at in-zone pitches

- Stamina – Pitcher's ability to remain in top form even as they lose Energy

  affects pitcher performance as they get more tired

- Stuff – Pitcher's ability to throw dirty pitches that result in more Ground Balls or Popups

  good, but reliant on your defense to pick up the easy outs. 

- **Velocity** – Pitcher's ability to throw hard and fast, making their pitches in the strike zone more effective

  This is the best stat for pretty much every pitcher, if you have the chance to raise it, you should

### Luck -  A player's ability to defy the odds
we are not sure how this affects player performance, if at all. It does seem related to some special events, such as tokens earned in the photo contest during Geomagnetic Storm weather.
