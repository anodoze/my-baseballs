# Beginner's Guide to MMOLB

Welcome to Massively Multiplayer Online League Baseball. We're all playing a work in progress, so it can be tough to get your bearings. Hopefully this can help. This guide is not meant to be comprehensive, but will hopefully cover enough ground to help you get started

## [MMOLB Official website](https://www.mmolb.com)

## Useful Third-Party Websites

[freecashews](https://freecashe.ws) - website for viewing player stats. You can search for your team on the [teams](https://freecashe.ws/teams) page and see how they're performing

[EMMOLB](https://lunanova.space) - this is a third-party viewer for mmolb, with a game viewer and player pages that are more-detailed than vanilla MMOLB. It also allows you to more easily follow more teams than just your own on MMOLB. 

#### EMMOLB wants my Team ID, what's that?

your Team ID is the string of numbers and letters at the end of the url on your public team page, for example:
[https://mmolb.com/team/**6806d81fee9f269dec724b8a**](https://mmolb.com/team/6806d81fee9f269dec724b8a)

If you go to [Manage My Team](https://mmolb.com/manage-team), then click on your team's name, that will take your team's page, where you can find the ID. freecashews will also show the Team ID when you search for your team. 

## Choosing a Favorite Team
This choice determines which Greater League team you'll be following, which will put their games on the home page when the Greater League is playing. It also determines which Lesser League your team plays in. During the regular season, you only play games against teams in your Lesser League. At the end of each season, the League Champion will have a player called up to the Greater League. All league members can vote on which player this will be in addition to the site-wide Proclamations.

You can choose a new Favorite Team at the following times:
- when you first join MMOLB
- during the first half of an ongoing season
- sometimes, during breaks, though due to technical shenaningans this can vary

## Drafting your Team

If you've just signed up, the player slots in Manage My Team will be empty. When you go to draft for that position, you'll be given 3 players to choose from. These will stay the same if you back out, so don't worry about losing them if you have to go off and do something else. Once you're done drafting, your team will start playing in the next round of Lesser League matches.

On the draft page, you'll be shown the player's primary attributes for Pitching or Batting, depending on their position. There are also 3 stats on this page that are unusual:

- Luck: this will be grouped with Defense later, but its effects are not well-understood and are probably relevant to all players
- Baserunning: this is an average of 4 attributes 
- Defense: this is an average of 8 attributes

You will be able to get more-detailed access to defense and baserunning after you've drafted.

For more detail on what these attributes do, see the [Attributes](#attributes) section

## Daily Activities
