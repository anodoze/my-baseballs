Gooooood mmolbing frogfans! 10 seasons in and this little anniversary has brought dramatic changes across the league, a whirlwind of re-booning has made for a highly unpredictable season, depending on whose superstars came out intact. The Shine might be good now? They have to be good now, right? That's why we lost to them 8 times?

We're sitting in the middle of a very tight race for Clover playoff spots, in a way it's anyone's game, but the back half of our schedule looks tougher than the front, it'll be a tough climb. If it comes to it, maybe we swipe a spot from Pineapple?

**Yui Nakanishi** has been a killer at the plate, clearing 1.000 OPS in a season where .800 is elite.

Rookie **Hye-Jin Wojciechowski** is struggling under the weight of season 10 pitching, so far only managing a an airplane OPS of .747. We'll see if they can turn it around in the back half.

Steady hand **Sam Genet** came out of the changes throwing absolute dirt. Who needs strikeouts? just toss it to the infield for a 1.79 ERA

The rest of the rotation... we'll get to you
