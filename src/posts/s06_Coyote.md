## Season 6 - Day 94 - Bottom of the 6th.

**Smiley - Chief of Police at Freeze Criminal Person**

The hunger growls ferociously at him from deep within the pit of his stomach, sending sharp jolts through his spine. It's unending, insatiable and forever clawing at all corners begging to be fulfilled. He knows he can only hold back the desire temporarily, the control it will take though, is inevitable.

The dark brown mess of hair pokes out from under his completely normal Fred Perry baseball cap (if you ignore the teeth). He kicks up the dust under him, the hunger peeling at his skin. To his left Hye-Jin is stood looking at him sideways patiently observing the now spitting, almost feral animal snarling on the base, this wasn’t new to them, they'd been here many times before. 

Coyote had done the first part, howling as he sent the ball peeling away across the ground straight as an arrow from the plate only a matter of minutes previous. Detective Goober was sacrificed at second for that but that didn’t matter, the hunger was all that encompassed his mind. Here he was, now making indents in the brown dust at his feet on third, saliva dripping incessantly from the sides of his mouth, making pockmarks in the dust at his feet. He couldn’t hold it back any longer. It was consuming him, pulling at every fibre of his being, begging him to placate it…

As Lollygag sends a bullet roaring through the air at Pavel's feet, the hunger becomes too much. The hunger must be quelled. He launches his head back with a bloodcurdling yowl and without even feeling the ground beneath his feet he lurched forwards, home.
